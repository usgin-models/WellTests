This repository contains document artifacts for an inforamtion exchange for Well tests from a well. The artifacts include an Excel Workbook that defines and documents the content model, and an XML schema that implements the model.
This spreadsheet defines the schema used for the interchange of well test observation results by the AASG geothermal data project for the National Geothermal Data System. The HeaderURI for a particular borehole (well for simple wells) is the cross-referencing link (foreign key) used to associate the header record, well logs, temperature measurements, and other information from a particular borehole. 
The 1.0 Well Tests content model and schema have been modified from DrillStemTests versions 1.8 and 1.9, and now supersedes those content models, pending approval.  2013-03-07
